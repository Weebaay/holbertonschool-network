# Networking Basics #0

## Description

This project explores the fundamental concepts of computer networking. It covers theoretical models, protocols, and essential tools to understand how modern networks function.

## Resources

### Read or Watch:

- **OSI model**: Understand the layered organization of a network.
- **Different types of network**: LAN, WAN, and Internet.
- **MAC address**: A unique identifier for each network interface.
- **What is an IP address**: Private and public addresses, IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Localhost**: The 127.0.0.1 address.
- **TCP and UDP**: Major differences between these transport protocols.
- **TCP/UDP ports List**: Common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
- **What is ping / ICMP**: Used for diagnosing network connections.

### man or help:

- `netstat`
- `ping`

## Learning Objectives

### OSI Model
- What is the OSI model?
- How many layers does it have?
- How is it organized?

### LAN
- Typical usage.
- Typical geographical size.

### WAN
- Typical usage.
- Typical geographical size.

### Internet
- What is the Internet?

### IP Address
- The two types of IP addresses (private and public).
- What is localhost?
- What is a subnet?
- Why was IPv6 created?

### TCP/UDP
- The two main protocols for IP transport.
- Key difference between TCP and UDP.

### Ports
- Port numbers for SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).

### ICMP
- What tool or protocol is commonly used to check if a device is connected to a network?

## Requirements

- **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- Bash scripts must be compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory.
- Bash scripts must be executable.
- Use `shellcheck` to validate Bash scripts.
- The first line of Bash scripts must be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- The second line must include a comment explaining the script's purpose.

### 4. TCP and UDP ports
- Identify common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
- Create a Bash script to display listening ports.
- **Repo:** `holbertonschool-network/basics_0/4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`

### 5. Is the host on the network
- Create a Bash script using `ping` to test connectivity.
- **Repo:** `holbertonschool-network/basics_0/5-is_the_host_on_the_network`
